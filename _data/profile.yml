short_bio: 
  I am a Master student in Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), under the supervision of Prof. Guangzhong Sun. I received my Bachelor degree in the Talent Program in AI (Honor) from School of the Gifted Young, USTC in 2024. <br>
  My research interests lie broadly in designing efficient machine learning systems, including model compression algorithms (sparsity, quantization, neural architecture search) and co-designed GPU kernels.
